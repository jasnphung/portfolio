## About the repository
The purpose of this repository is to serve as a part of labs and assignments for CSI 3140 [Z], the WWW Structures, Techniques, and Standards course from the University of Ottawa.

Inside the public folder, you can find the files for assignment 1 (index.html and styles.css), where as per the provided instructions, a resume is displayed through HTML and CSS.

In the "Projects" section of the portfolio, we have included images that visually represent the projects described in the resume. Please note that these images are created specifically for this assignment and do not represent the actual projects.
