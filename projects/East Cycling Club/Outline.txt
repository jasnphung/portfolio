The Book-A-Stay project focuses on creating a website for customers and employees to utilize for browsing, booking, and renting out rooms for hotels. It enables employees to rent rooms directly to customers without prior booking while maintaining a comprehensive database of both bookings and rentings. Key requirements include creating an ER diagram, relational database schema, and defining constraints to ensure data integrity. The database should handle deletions of hotel chains, hotels, and rooms, while preserving historical booking/renting data. The project involves implementing the database with initial data for hotel chains, hotels, and rooms, and ensuring SQL modifications via queries and triggers. It also includes designing a user-friendly interface for customers and employees to manage room bookings/rentings and customer payments. Two specific SQL views were required: the number of available rooms per area and the capacity of rooms in a specific hotel. Deliverables include detailed reports, SQL code, application code, and a recorded presentation, with PostgreSQL/MySQL, Apache Tomcat, PHP/Java, and HTML recommended for development.
