The GCC Cycling Mobile Application project, developed in the SEG 2105 course at the University of Ottawa, aimed to create a centralized hub for cycling-related activities. The application, designed for administrators, cycling club owners, and participants, facilitates event coordination, registration, and profile management. Developed using Java in Android Studio with Firebase for backend support, the project followed a client-server architecture. Key contributions from team members included front-end and back-end development, UI enhancements, and implementing various features such as login/registration, event management, and user role-specific functionalities. The project adhered to Agile development principles and utilized effective team communication and version control practices. Future improvements could include refining UI designs and utilizing fragments for smoother navigation.
